CLASS 1
Data and Information

Data is raw, unprocessed facts.

Information is meaningful insights derived from data.

Types of Data

Structured data – stored in tables (rows and columns).

Unstructured data – text, images, videos, emails.

Semi-structured data – JSON, XML, logs.

Data Storage

Relational databases

JSON files

Key-value storage

Distributed storage systems

ETL and ELT

ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)

Data is transformed before loading into storage.

ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)

Data is loaded first, then transformed.

ELT is more cost-effective, especially in cloud environments, because cloud systems can handle transformation at scale.

Batch Processing

Data is collected over a period of time.

Processed at fixed intervals (daily, weekly).

Suitable for large volumes of data.

Change Data Capture (CDC)

Captures only changes made in source systems.

Avoids full data reload.

Improves performance and efficiency.

Data Pipelines

A data pipeline is a flow that moves data from source to destination.

Should be:

Modular

Reusable

Fault-tolerant

Includes ingestion, processing, and storage stages.

Data Warehouse

A Data Warehouse stores structured and processed data.

Used for analytics and reporting.

Separates analytical workload from transactional systems.

Data Warehouse Layers (Medallion Architecture)

Bronze – raw data

Silver – cleaned and transformed data

Gold – aggregated, analytics-ready data

Definition of Hadoop

Hadoop is a distributed framework used to store and process large volumes of data.

Designed for big data and parallel processing.

Definition of Spark

Apache Spark is a fast, in-memory data processing engine.

Designed to process large-scale data efficiently.
