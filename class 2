Hadoop – Detailed Explanation
Hadoop Overview

Hadoop works on distributed storage and parallel processing.

Data is stored across multiple machines.

Hadoop Components

HDFS (Storage layer)

MapReduce (Processing layer)

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

Stores large data across multiple nodes.

Data is split into blocks and replicated.

Components:

NameNode – stores metadata.

DataNode – stores actual data.

Hadoop Processing – MapReduce

Map phase

Input data is split into smaller parts.

Processed in parallel.

Reduce phase

Aggregates output from map phase.

Spark – Detailed Explanation
Spark Overview

Spark uses in-memory processing, making it faster than Hadoop.

Reduces disk I/O operations.

Spark Architecture

Driver Program – controls execution.

Cluster Manager – allocates resources.

Executors – perform computations.

Spark Layers

Spark Core

Spark SQL

Spark Streaming

MLlib

GraphX

MapReduce Concept in Spark

Spark performs operations using DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

Faster and optimized compared to traditional MapReduce.

Hadoop vs Spark
Hadoop	Spark
Disk-based processing	In-memory processing
Slower execution	Faster execution
High fault tolerance	High performance
Uses MapReduce	Uses DAG execution
