SELECT *
Used to retrieve all records from a table.
SELECT * FROM students;
________________________________________
SELECT DISTINCT
Used to return only unique values from a column.
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
________________________________________
SELECT COUNT(*)
Used to count the total number of rows in a table.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
________________________________________
LIMIT
Used to restrict the number of records returned.
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
WHERE (Filtering)
Used to filter records based on conditions.
SELECT * FROM abc WHERE xyz = 'L' AND length >= 92;
________________________________________
ORDER BY (Sorting)
Used to sort the result in ascending or descending order.
SELECT * FROM abc ORDER BY marks DESC;
________________________________________
AND / OR Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause.
SELECT * FROM abc WHERE age > 18 AND city = 'NY';
________________________________________
NOT Operator
Used to exclude records that match a condition.
SELECT * FROM abc WHERE city NOT IN ('NY', 'LA');
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade NOT = 'A';
→ returns students whose grade is not A

NOT IN
Used to exclude multiple values from a result.
Example:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE city NOT IN ('NY', 'LA', 'TX');
→ returns students whose city is not NY, LA, or TX
•  NOT excludes a single condition
•  NOT IN excludes multiple values

________________________________________
LIKE (Pattern Matching)
Used with WHERE to search for a specific pattern in a column.
SELECT * FROM abc WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

Wildcards used with LIKE
There are two wildcards commonly used with the LIKE operator:
________________________________________
% (percent sign)
Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
Example:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
→ retrieves words that start with A
________________________________________
_ (underscore)
Represents exactly one single character.
Example:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name LIKE 'A_';
→ retrieves words with two characters, starting with A
________________________________________
Using position-based matching
When we know the exact position of characters, _ is used.
Example:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE word LIKE '_s_a___';
Explanation:
•	_ → any single character
•	s → must be in 2nd position
•	_ → any single character
•	a → must be in 4th position
•	___ → any three characters
This retrieves words where s is in the 2nd position and a is in the 4th position.
________________________________________
Understanding given examples
%A%A
•	% → any characters before
•	A → first A
•	% → any characters in between
•	A → second A
→ retrieves words that contain the letter A at least twice.
________________________________________
A%s
•	A → word must start with A
•	% → any number of characters in between
•	s → word must end with s
→ retrieves words that start with A and end with s, regardless of length.
________________________________________
Important Note
•	Pattern matching using LIKE is case-sensitive (depends on database settings).
•	Uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different values.
________________________________________
One-line exam memory
•	% → many characters
•	_ → one character
•	NULL values
NULL means the value is missing or unknown.
To check NULL values, we use IS NULL (not =).
•	Example:
SELECT name FROM students WHERE email IS NULL;
→ retrieves students whose email is not provided.
•	________________________________________
•	BETWEEN
BETWEEN is used to filter values within a specific range (both limits included).
•	Example:
SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks BETWEEN 60 AND 90;
→ retrieves students whose marks are between 60 and 90.
GROUP BY is used to combine rows that have the same value in a column and treat them as one group.
HAVING is used to filter those groups.
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM abc
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) <= 30
ORDER BY count DESC;
•  Rows are grouped by customer_id
•  COUNT(*) calculates how many times each customer appears
•  HAVING filters the grouped result
•  ORDER BY sorts the output in descending order
What GROUP BY does
GROUP BY combines rows with the same value into one group.
After grouping, SQL can display only:
•	The column used in GROUP BY
•	Aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX
Individual row values cannot be displayed after grouping.
________________________________________
Why GROUP BY is needed
If a table has 1000 rows of sales data:
•	“Total sales” → one result
•	“Total sales per city” → multiple results
GROUP BY allows SQL to return one result per group.
GROUP BY rule (very important)
Every column in the SELECT statement must:
•	Be included in GROUP BY, or
•	Be used inside an aggregate function
SELECT city, SUM(amount)
FROM sales
GROUP BY city
HAVING SUM(amount) > 250;
SQL execution order
FROM
JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
LIMIT
HAVING condition rule
The condition used in HAVING must reference:
•	The same column used in GROUP BY, or
•	An aggregate function on that column
Difference between WHERE and HAVING
•	WHERE works at the row level
•	HAVING works at the group level

Important note
GROUP BY and HAVING are commonly used to identify duplicate records in a table.
