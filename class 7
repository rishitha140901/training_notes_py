Bridge Table (Junction Table)
What is a Bridge Table?

A bridge table is used to handle a many-to-many relationship between two tables.

Why do we need it?

Relational databases cannot store many-to-many relationships directly, so we break it into two one-to-many relationships using a bridge table.

Example

One actor → many films

One film → many actors

Tables

actor

film

film_actor ← bridge table

Bridge table contains:

Foreign key from table 1

Foreign key from table 2

film_actor
-----------
actor_id
film_id

Key rule

Many-to-many = bridge table

2️⃣ SQL JOINs
What is a JOIN?

A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

INNER JOIN

Returns only matching rows from both tables.

SELECT *
FROM customer c
JOIN rental r
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id;

LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table.

SELECT *
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN rental r
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id;


Used when:

You want all records, including unmatched ones.

RIGHT JOIN

Returns all rows from the right table.

(MySQL supports it but used less often.)

FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows from both tables.
(MySQL does not support it directly.)

👉 Simulated using UNION.

3️⃣ Normalization
What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data to:

Reduce redundancy

Avoid anomalies

Improve data integrity

🔹 1NF (First Normal Form)

Rules:

Atomic values (no multiple values in one column)

No repeating groups

❌ Not 1NF:

phone_numbers = 12345, 67890


✅ 1NF:

phone_number
12345
67890

🔹 2NF (Second Normal Form)

Rules:

Must be in 1NF

No partial dependency

Applies to tables with composite primary keys

📌 Partial dependency:

Non-key column depends on part of the primary key

🔹 3NF (Third Normal Form)

Rules:

Must be in 1NF & 2NF

No transitive dependency

📌 Transitive dependency:

A non-key column depends on another non-key column

🔹 Denormalization

Opposite of normalization

Used in Data Warehousing

Improves query performance

Allows redundancy

📌 OLTP → normalized
📌 OLAP / Data Warehouse → denormalized

4️⃣ WHERE EXISTS
What is EXISTS?

EXISTS checks whether a subquery returns any rows.

Returns TRUE or FALSE

Stops searching once a match is found (efficient)

Example
SELECT *
FROM customer c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM rental r
    WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id
);


👉 Returns customers who have at least one rental
